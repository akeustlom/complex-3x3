# complex-3x3
A simulator for the "Complex 3x3" twisty puzzle. Basically, a Rubik's Cube with a lot more pieces.
The cube does not follow a standard control-scheme, unfortunately for those who are used to solving virtual cubes on other websites.
The Back, Down, Front, Left, Right, and Up faces are all turned clockwise by pressing their respective button on the keyboard. (B for 'Back', etc.)
Holding 'Shift' while performing a move will cause the desired move to be performed counterclockwise.
The entire cube can be rotated on its three axes, x, y, and z. X rotates the cube in the same direction as a clockwise R. Y rotates the cube in the same direction as U. Z rotates the cube in the same direction as F, and these operations can be negated as well.
That's about it! Enjoy the puzzle!
